  "description": "If you are like me, you love golf. But with so many golf courses around, it can be expensive trying each one out to find one that you like. Sure you can look up course handicaps, consumer reviews, and comments from other golfers. But reviews can be very vague and unhelpful. That is why the Golfer's buddy application helps review golf courses on specific categories that anyone can understand. With Golfer's buddy, you can lookup a nearby course and see general information about the course from other golfers. With rating categories like: overall course condition, slice friendliness, picturesque value, pace of play, and others you can quickly see if the golf course is worth the money. New reviews and ratings are automatically updated to give you the most recent information and reviews. Be confident that even when you can't hit your driver, you can still enjoy your golf round.",
